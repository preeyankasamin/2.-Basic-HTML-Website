## Introduction  
This project demonstrates how websites were traditionally built using basic HTML techniques. It’s a simple yet effective portfolio with pages for Home, Projects, Articles, and Contact, organized using `<table>`-based layouts and older HTML attributes.  

---

## Features  
- **Page Layout**:  
  - Built with `<table>` tags to structure content and layout.  
  - Includes deprecated HTML attributes like `align`, `border`, and inline styles for element positioning.  

- **Navigation**:  
  - Seamless navigation between pages using `<a>` tags (Home, Projects, Articles, Contact).  

- **Content Highlights**:  
  - Header: Links to professional profiles like LinkedIn and GitHub.  
  - Forms: A contact form with fields for name, email, and message.  
  - Main Section: Showcases experience, education, and projects using nested tables.  
  - Footer: Displays reviews and teacher comments in separate table cells.  

- **Old-School Design**:  
  - Styling with `<font>` and `<b>` tags, instead of modern CSS.  
  - Relies on inline attributes rather than external stylesheets.

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- Basic inline styling (no CSS)
